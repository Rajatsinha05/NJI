  description: `Driven by a strong belief that success isn't just about crossing borders but about making meaningful connections, Karan Bhojak's journey in founding New Journey Immigration began with a simple yet powerful idea. With years of hands-on experience in the industry, he recognized that the immigration field lacked true transparency and personalized support.

  Under his leadership, what started as a modest one-person operation in Mehsana has grown into a trusted international brand. Karan's vision of providing clear, honest guidance has shaped NJI's core values and operational philosophy. His hands-on approach and commitment to client success have been instrumental in building a team that shares his passion for making immigration accessible and empowering.`,
